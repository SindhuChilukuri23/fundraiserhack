        <h3 class = "t3">Fundraising is the process of gathering voluntary contributions of money or other resources carried out by non-profit making organisations — NGOs, foundations, associations, collectives, etc. — in order to be able to implement their projects. Different types of resources can be gathered depending on the situation and the organisation: food and water, medicines, toys, clothing — but primarily money. Even the recruitment of volunteers can be considered as fundraising.</h3>
